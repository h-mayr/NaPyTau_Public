Specifically, the module is responsible for reading and processing previously stored experimental data (import) and for saving computed results along with their associated datasets (export).</p> <p>A key design principle of the Import&amp;Export module is modularity. To achieve this, the module defines a common internal representation of all relevant information. Any imported data is transformed into this unified format before being made available to other parts of the system. This ensures that all system components operate on a consistent and standardized set of data structures, eliminating the need for each module to handle multiple formats or perform individual data conversions.</p> <p>Given this central role in data standardization, any modifications or refactoring of the data structures within the Import&amp;Export module should be approached with caution. Changes to these structures can have a system-wide impact, potentially affecting all modules that rely on the standardized data representation.
